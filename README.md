# AfroScanned
AfroScanned is an art installation which explores photogrammetric computer vision and colour as related to race and colour in film.

## Welcome! 
Thanks to advances in computer vision and photogrammetry, it is now possible to explore what it feels like to create second virtual selves. AfroScanned seeks to expand diverse representations of people online and, in the future, renditions of humanness in digital formats. 

We invite you to 3D scan yourself, so we can add it our display at the Mozilla Festival for the weekend of October 27-29, 2017. Please below for tips on how to try DIY photogrammetry. 

Alternatively, join us at the Mozfest! We will be providing a workshop for participants to learn about photogrammetry; following this introduction, participants will have a chance to 3D scan themselves.

## Wait, so what is photogrammetry? What is computer vision? How do they work together? 

Photogrammetry is the art, science and technology of gathering reliable information about the world around us. This is done through taking serveral photographs of an object or space of interest and collating the images using an algorithm. The algorithm then constructs an 3D model using this information. Computer vision refers to the methods a computer uses to acquire, process and analyze digital imagery. Consequently, in order for photogrammetry to work, a computer must use computer vision to process the images taken through the scans and, through the algorithm, analyze these images to create the resulting 3D model. 

## If you canâ€™t make it to the Mozilla Festival, you can still try DIY photogrammetry!

So you want to try photogrammetry, that's awesome! Here are some software and apps which allow you to scan yourself.

<strong>The Scanning Space</strong> </br>
<em><strong>1</strong></em> Generally, we advise scanning with your phone, computer or ipad about 1-2 metres away from you.</br>
<em><strong>2</strong></em> Ensure the space is well lit--the camera needs to see you clearly and uniformly. These means no backlighting and no other objects such as chairs or tables should be in the camera's view. </br>
<em><strong>3</strong></em> When capturing the scans, ensure the images overlap much like a panormic view. This provides for imformation for the algorithm to render a better model. </br>

<strong>Tips and Tricks </strong></br>
Reflective objects generally do not scan well. Save the reflective clothing for bicycling at night! </br>
Stand on a white sheet, it will help the camera place you in physical space when connecting the images through the algorithm.</br> 


## Love your scan? Be part of our installation! 

Great! Upload your scan to Sketchfab, mention us on Twitter at @mypaere with the hashtag #afroscanned2017 and we'll add it to our installation for Mozilla Festival.
